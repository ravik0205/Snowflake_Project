# Snowflake_Project
# End-to-End Data Engineering Project with Snowflake & Azure  

## 🛠️ Project Overview  
This project focuses on implementing a modern data engineering solution for an **e-commerce company** with over **5M customers**, addressing challenges in **data management**, **processing delays**, **scalability**, **data quality**, and **advanced analytics**.

The solution leverages **Snowflake** and **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)** to build a robust data pipeline that centralizes data, enables near real-time analytics, and supports advanced business insights.

## 🚀 Business Problem  
The e-commerce company faced the following challenges:  
1. **Data Silos:** Fragmented data across systems.  
2. **Processing Delays:** 24-hour delays in batch processing.  
3. **Scalability Issues:** On-prem infrastructure unable to handle increasing data volumes.  
4. **Data Quality Problems:** Inconsistent data formats and lack of standardization.  
5. **Limited Analytics:** Insufficient support for advanced analytics and machine learning initiatives.

## 🎯 Project Goals  
- **Centralized Data Source:** Break down data silos.  
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Reduce processing delays.  
- **Scalability:** Handle growing data volumes with ease.  
- **Enhanced Data Quality:** Standardize and clean data.  
- **Advanced Analytics:** Support machine learning and personalized marketing.

## 🔧 Architecture Overview  
### Data Flow:  
1. **Source Systems:**  
   - **Customer Data:** Daily CSV files from CRM.  
   - **Product Data:** Hourly JSON updates from inventory systems.  
   - **Transactional Logs:** Real-time Parquet files from the website.  
2. **Pipeline:**  
   - Data → **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)** → **Snowflake** → **BI Tools**  

### Multi-Layer Architecture:  
- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion.  
- **Silver Layer:** Data cleaning and transformations.  
- **Gold Layer:** Business-level aggregates for reporting and analytics.  

### Key Snowflake Features:  
- **External Storage:** Connecting ADLS to Snowflake for seamless data integration.  
- **COPY Command:** Efficient data loading.  
- **Streams & Tasks:** Automating incremental data loading and transformations.

## 🧹 Data Transformations  
Examples of cleaning and standardization tasks:  
- **Email Validation:** Ensure email is not null.  
- **Customer Type Standardization:** Normalize to `Regular`, `Premium`, or `Unknown`.  
- **Age Validation:** Validate age is between 18 and 120.  
- **Gender Classification:** Standardize gender to `Male`, `Female`, or `Other`.  

---

## ✅ Project Outcomes  
- Reduced data processing delays from **24 hours to 1 hour**.  
- Improved data quality and reporting accuracy.  
- Scalable infrastructure to handle peak loads.  
- Enabled real-time analytics and set the foundation for advanced ML use cases.
